Script used to run a rangewide. multi-population apparent annual survival analysis (CJS) for a declining songbird, the Golden-winged Warblers. Data was sourced from 19 sites across their range (8 sites represent the Appalachian population and 11 sites represent the Great Lakes population). Capture-mark-recapture data were collected by collaborators during field seasons ranging from 1980-2022. Data was used if capture histories could be generated for unique individuals with at least three years of presence/absence information. The purpose of these models is to provide informed regional-, site-, and sex-specific apparent annual survival estimates to identify particular spatial or demographic populations that might be driving species decline. 

Files in the repository include two apparent annual survival models: one for the Appalachians and one for the Great Lakes. It also includes code that was used to run simulations to see under which scenarios we could expect to increase precision in our parameters. Different scenarios included running survival models that involved different occasion lengths (3, 6, and 9 years), different levels of female representation in the datasets (30% and 50%), different sample sizes of initial capture at each occasion (10, 30, and 50), and different recapture probabilities (30%, 60%, and 90%).
